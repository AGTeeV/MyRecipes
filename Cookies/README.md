My favorite food is cookies, I like cookies because there soft and come in different types/flavor and all sizes. Some cookies crumble in your mouth, and some are hard and don't crumble when you bite into it. I personally don't like cookies that are hard and crumbly because they are not as tasty and the flavor like disappears , I like the moist, soft cookies. I have had cookies that break in my hands because there to soft. Chocolate Chip cookies are my favorite because I like the chocolaty taste In my mouth. Also I like them better then having plain cookies because it adds a new taste. You can make them by taking store bought dough and adding anything you want to it.
